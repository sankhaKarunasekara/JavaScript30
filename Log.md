as kick start picked up Wes Bos's javascript30 course. 

* I didn't know `<kbd></kbd>` is a tag in HTML. It's used to define keyboard inputs. The tag is used when it is needed to display text that the user should enter into their keyboard (for any number of reasons).

*`transform` in css used for `transform: scale(1.1);` inside a class will scale up what ever in the class by 10% present. 
*`transitionend` is a event you can use to listen to a end of a transition. 

* backtics and template syntax are great way contact strings in javascript. 
   `const key = document.querySelector(`div[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]`);`

* you can add add `EventListners` to html page by, 
  `window.addEventListener('keydown', playSound);`
